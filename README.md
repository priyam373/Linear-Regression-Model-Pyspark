# Linear-Regression-Model-Pyspark'
This notebook contains the Pyspark code to create a machine learning model for a waiter's tip data set which aims to predict the tip ammount based on several independent features. This notebook has orginally been created in Databricks and the dataset has been obtained from Kaggle from the below link:

# Idea behind this model:
Usually Spark architecture is used for big data processing or to process/handle a large amount of data where the proccessing of the data can be made faster with the help of in-memory processing. The benefits of Spark can be leveraged via Databricks. Databricks has been integrated with a lot of cloud providers such as Google, Azure or AWS therefore, it can be used through any of these CSP. The purpose of creating this machine learning model is to learn how to use Databricks, Pyspark, create clusters with worker and driver nodes and how to make it scalable and retieve data from data lake for processing.
